    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Tyler Gast. I was born August 10th, 1996 making me 28 years old. I grew up near Lake Wissota
        in Chippewa Falls WI with my mom, dad, and one older brother. Growing up, my brother and I raced motocross almost every
        weekend from April - October for about 10 years and I still ride to this day. I graduated from Chippewa Falls Senior
        High school in 2014. After high school I had no real plans of what I wanted to do for a career, but that changed a couple
        of years ago when I decided to go back to school. Growing up I always felt like I was good with computers and gaming and
        things like that, so I decided to enroll in the IT - Software Development program offered at Chippewa Valley Technical College.
        I graduate with honors soon, and I'm excited and eager to start my career in the computer industry.
